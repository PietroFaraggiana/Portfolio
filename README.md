Welcome to my personal portfolio website! 
# Hi there! I'm Pietro Faraggiana

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Italian student passionate about hardware electronics, quantum computing, and AI accelerators. I started with a bachelor in Physics, but my interest in electronics led me to pursue a Master's in Electronics Engineering (expected to be completed in late 2026) in hope to find a path combing these two subjects.
